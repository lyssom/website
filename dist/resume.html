I've participated in almost every one since 2010, back when there were only 284 other participants. Ludum Dare has grown a lot, and there are 2901 entries in the latest jam. I am proud of all of the games I've created for Ludum Dare, but there are too many to list all of them. You can see the full list of games at <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thristhart/">http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thristhart/</a> and on the new LD site at <a href="https://ldjam.com/users/thristhart/games">https://ldjam.com/users/thristhart/games</a>. Here are some highlights:</p><ul class="details"><li><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=3164">WHISTLE COMMAND</a>, a game you control by whistling. First place out of 2821 other entries in both Innovation and Theme.</li><li><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=3164">SneakyLink</a>, a game about chatting.

Kitchen Sync is a web app that allows users to sync up media (not just youtube, but also mp4 files, audio, etc) such that everyone is seeing the same thing at the same time. It even factors in latency and distance to make sure it feels like everyone is in the same room together.</p><ul class="details"><li><a class="github" href="https://github.com/Thristhart/kitchensync-rebuild">Kitchen Sync on Github</a></li><li>Websocket communication for high-accuracy syncing</li><li>Modular design allows for new 'faucets' (eg the youtube faucet controls youtube sync) to be added easily</li><li>I still use this app daily to watch things with my friends</li></ul></section><section class="project"><h4>Cyrclebot</h4><span class="daterange"><time datetime="2014-12">December 2014</time> &ndash; <time datetime="2015-10">October 2016</time></span><p class="description">A bot for Mumble that plays youtube videos over VOIP.
