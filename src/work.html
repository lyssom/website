      <h2>The new Microsoft Store on Xbox</h2>
      <p>
        In June of 2019, just as E3 was wrapping up, my team at Xbox prototyped
        an Xbox app, to prove out
        <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/"
          >React Native Windows</a
        >. That app would eventually come to replace the Microsoft Store on
        Xbox, releasing to the world in September of 2020. Built from the ground
        up to support a fast, console-first experience, the new store is
        designed to be navigated with a controller and architected with
        performance as the first priority.

            <h3>Blazing fast launch time</h3>
            <p>
              The new store launches way way faster - as much as 600% faster
              than the old one, with a median cold boot launch time of 500ms.

      <p>
        At <a href="https://verve.com">Verve</a>, I built and prototyped
        cutting-edge mobile ad experiences. I've been involved with every part
        of the ad building process: meeting with clients, working out the
        design, developing the ad itself and deciding what metrics to report on.
        I haven't just built the ads, but designed and developed the core
        framework that powered Verve's ad development and prototyped nearly
        every new ad format Verve introduced for 3 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these ads were built in less than 2 weeks, thanks to work I led
        on tools and processes that allowed Verve to offer industry-leading
        turnaround times.

              barely-functional prototype before I started at Verve, but I took
              it over and rebuilt it to modern standards, with test-driven
              development and functional components. It now uses an intelligent
              Constraint Satisifaction Problem solver to balance developer and
              designer workloads and specialties between different types of
              tasks. sf2jira is a core part of the Foundry infrastructure,

              The Creative Showcase is an internal tool built to help account
              managers, sales and designers find existing examples of ads that
              we've built. It's entirely automated, pulling information from
              JIRA, Salesforce and internal services together to enable anyone
              to find whatever information they need. The frontend is built in
              Vue, using IndexedDB for caching and searching through creative
              data.

      <p>
        I've been participating in Ludum Dare competition and jam events since
        December 2010, when I was only just barely getting started with game
        development. Every time I compete I try to do something I've never done
        before, and so LD has strongly shaped my approach to design and
        development. I've learned a lot from Ludum Dare, even when my games
        aren't the greatest. That said, I also have quite a few games that I'm
        proud of, which I'll highlight here.

              SneakyLink is a chat-based game, in which you are attempting to
              infiltrate a group of script kiddies, one of which is supposed to
              have stolen some important document. It is built on a javascript
              windowing engine and psuedo-chat framework that I built in the
              48-hour competition, which unfortunately didn't leave enough time
              to finish the writing. Still, it shows off the possibilities of a
              game built on this fake-OS interface, which was later proven by
              games like <a href="http://emilyisaway.com/">Emily is Away</a> in
              2015 and

              <li>Theme: Entire Game on One Screen</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              cover is an experiment in trying to put a lot of depth into an
              interface without ever opening any new windows or menus (thus
              keeping the "entire game on one screen" theme). It's also an
              incremental game, back from when that genre wasn't as well known
              as it is now and Cookie Clicker was the go-to example. I wanted to
              make a more physical sort of incremental game, where the resource
              you accumulate directly impacts the space you're playing in. The
              interface ended up a little confusing, but once you understand it
              it's pretty fluid. This game also features the dumb jokes I like
              to put in my LD games, like the "armory" that generates stick arms
              for your snowmen.

              was only very recently available, and I had been itching to use it
              in something, so I tried a simple prototype of controlling the
              position of a dot with the pitch from your microphone. I found it
              immediately engaging and built a little game around it with my
              remaining time. I did not have very much time for the graphics,
              which is... apparent.

              It was the most positive feedback I've ever recieved in a Ludum
              Dare, winning first place in both the Innovation and Theme
              categories. It also led to a comment that I aspire to replicate
              with everything I build:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              Oh my god this is such a great idea. I literally could not get
              past the rapid fire because I started laughing too much. I've
              never seen a mechanic convey laughter that well before.

            <p>
              Ludum Dare 34 was unusual in that the two highest-voted themes
              were tied, and so it was a dual-theme jam -- you could use either
              or both themes in your entry. I knew immediately that I wanted to
              use both, and that I wanted to make something relaxing and chill.
              In the LD prior to this one (33), I started to partipate in the
              Jam rather than the Competition, which meant I had an extra day
              and could work with a team. This meant a marked increase in the
              quality of my art assets, as I could lean on friends who are much
              better at it than me! I also made use of
              <a href="https://bbatv.bandcamp.com/"
                >bbatv's wonderful song ", isn't the rain nice today?"</a

              With thanks, I hate it!, I wanted to create something that
              surprised you with what it was willing to do. I was looking for
              that moment of laughter when something unexpected happens. I also
              wanted to make something aggressively unpleasant, because that was
              how I read the theme - the more you play this game, the worse it
              is. It's sort of an incremental game that actively punishes you
              for succeeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              On a technical note, I used this as an opportunity to try out Web
              Components, which I found very helpful for this format. I used a
              polyfill but otherwise focused on just HTML-standard web
              components, which I think were a great choice that allowed me to
              very rapidly prototype.
